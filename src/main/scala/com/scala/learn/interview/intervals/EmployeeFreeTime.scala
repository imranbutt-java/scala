/**
 * Employee Free Time (hard) #
 * For â€˜Kâ€™ employees, we are given a list of intervals representing the working hours of each employee.
 * Our goal is to find out if there is a free interval that is common to all employees. You can assume
 * that each list of employee working hours is sorted on the start time.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [5,6]], [[2,3], [6,8]]]
 * Output: [3,5]
 * Explanation: Both the employees are free between [3,5].
