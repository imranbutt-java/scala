A string is considered balanced when every letter in the string appears both in uppercase and lowercase
For example, CATattac is balanced (a, c, t occur in both cases). Madam is not (a, d only appear in lowercase).
Write a function that given a string returns the shortest balanced substring of that string.
Can this be solved with a sliding window approach?
Update:
More examples
“azABaabza” returns “ABaab”
“TacoCat” returns -1 (not balanced)
“AcZCbaBz” returns the entire string
